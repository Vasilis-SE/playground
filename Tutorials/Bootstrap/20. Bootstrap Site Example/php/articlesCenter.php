		<p>Sign-Up.to is committed to helping reduce the problems of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) or ‘Spam’.</p>
		<p>The Sign-Up.to system allows only verified opt-in subscriptions, and ensures that all consumers can opt-out quickly, easily and permanently from any communication they receive, be it email or SMS.</p>
		<h5>Our definition of spam</h5>
		<ul>
		<li>We view any unsolicited, unexpected email/SMS as spam.</li>
		<li>We don’t allow use of 3rd party lists, whether consent has been gathered or not. We don’t believe that consent is transferrable between organisations.</li>
		<li>We believe that any communications sent to a subscriber about an unrelated subject to that which they requested to be kept informed about are spam.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sign-Up.to is registered under the Data Protection Act to handle personal data, and we are proactive in ensuring that personal data is kept safe.</p>
		<h5>Spam reports</h5>
		<p>If you have received a communication from a Sign-Up.to member and are unsure of why you have received it please forward the email, or contents of the text message to: <a href="mailto:abuse.reports@sign-up.to">abuse.reports@sign-up.to</a> and we will look into the matter and contact you to resolve the issue.</p>

		<h2></h2>
		<h2>Terms of service</h2>
		<p>These terms relate to use of the Sign-Up.to web application and related services. <a href="#tcTerms">For terms relating to general use of our website please click here.</a></p>
		<p>We like to keep things straight forward, so before we get to the legal stuff our lawyers say we have to have, here’s a plain english breakdown of the key things you need to know when using Sign-Up.to:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Your data remains yours at all times. We’ll never disclose your data to third parties unless required by law or requested by you.</li>
		<li>Unless otherwise arranged, we bill monthly based on the maximum number of active subscribers in your account during the previous month. Payments are collected by credit/debit card on the day of issue. Failure to pay on time will result in suspension of access until your invoice is paid.</li>
		<li>We provide free phone and email support during UK working days, from 9am – 5.30pm.</li>
		<li>Managed services (such as alterations to or creation of email campaigns or use of the service on your behalf) are subject to additional charges which will be agreed with you before the work is undertaken.</li>
		<li>We take permission very seriously. Sign-Up.to may only be used for permission-based data, without exception. Use of a purchased list or addresses obtained without permission will result in immediate termination of your account, without refund. We check all data uploaded to Sign-Up.to.</li>
		<li>We will not tolerate the sending of Spam messages. Spam is best defined by the recipient. If your complaint rate is excessive (as determined solely by Sign-Up.to) or in any case if your spam complaint rate (readers hitting the ‘this is spam’ button with their ISP) exceeds 0.3% this is grounds for immediate termination without refund.</li>
		<li>If you wish to cancel your account you can do so at any time with 30 days notice. Cancellations can only be made by sending an email to <a href="mailto:cancel@sign-up.to">cancel@sign-up.to</a> from the email address of the account administrator, for your security we will not accept verbal cancellation instructions. Cancellation will not be finalised until all outstanding invoices are paid. For annual contracts the full balance of the remaining contract period must be paid prior to cancellation.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>7.2 The Client acknowledges that, where SuTL does not own any pre-existing Materials, the Client’s use of rights in pre-existing Materials is conditional on SuTL obtaining a written licence (or sub-licence) from the relevant licensor or licensors on such terms as will entitle SuTL to license such rights to the Client.

		<p>7.4 The Client will not make any representation or do any act which may be taken to indicate that it has any right title or interest in or to the ownership or use of any of the Intellectual Property Rights except under the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledges that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Client any right, title or interest in or to the Intellectual Property save as granted hereby.</p>
